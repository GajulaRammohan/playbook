# Workflow

These are the ways we work with the rest of the team.

## Agile

While we have adopted some choice artifacts from Scrum, our workflow is best described as
just “agile”. Our projects vary in scope and duration and so we adopt our workflow accordingly,
but there are some key artifacts that a project should always have.

It is the project manager's responsibility to implement these, but if you notice that something
is missing you should step up and get it done.

### Backlog

You should keep a list of everything that remains to do. In Scrum, this list is called the “backlog”. We like
to format the items in the list as [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) in the interest of
keepings things straightforward and not too technical for everyone else to follow.

### Sprints

You should organize the backlog in [sprints]('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint').
We like for our sprints to last one week each, as our projects seldom span for more than a few months and
commonly much less.

#### Sprint planning

At the beginning of each sprint, you should have a sprint planning meeting. This is where you plan the next
iteration of your product. At the end of the meeting, the team should have committed to a week's worth of
user stories to implement.

We like to timebox sprint plannings to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What are we doing next week?

#### Sprint review

At the end of each sprint, you should have a sprint review meeting. This is where you review the previous
iteration of your product. At the end of the meeting, everyone should be agreed that the user stories were
implemented satisfactorily. The stories that are considered complete should be deployed, and the ones that
aren't should be moved back into the backlog.

We like to timebox sprint reviews to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What did we do last week?

#### Sprint retrospective

At the end of each sprint, you should have a sprint retrospective meeting. This is where you review how you
made the previous iteration of your product.

We like to timebox sprint retrospectives to 10 minutes with the following agenda:

* What should we start doing?
* What should we stop doing?
* What should we continue doing?

### Stand-ups

Every day, the developers and designers of a team should meet amongst themselves and have a
[stand-up](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum/). Project managers and advisors may
want to participate in this meeting and indeed are welcome to, but it is not required.

We like to timebox stand-ups to 15 minutes where everyone takes turns asking these questions of themselves:

* What did you do yesterday?
* What will you be doing today?
* Are there any impediments in your way?
