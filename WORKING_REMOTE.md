# Working Remote

*The goal of this document is to improve collaboration between people who
 are not working in the same physical location.*

 **Important: This document is not only for those who are working remotely,
 but for everyone working at Hyper.
 Successfully collaboration requires effort from everyone.**

We are all used to speaking with people who are not in the same
physical place as us. Although we communicate a bitt less effectively over
phone than when do in person it's usually not a big problem.

However this communication challenge becomes much more apparent to us when
we're trying to solve complex problems together.

There are many things that makes communicating with remote people more
difficult. Let's call them communication barriers.

## Communication barriers

To collaborate more effectively we need to remove communication barriers.
So let us discuss how to solve them and gather their solutions here

### Tips on how to remove collaboration barriers

*This section will focus on how we can remove
communication barriers by changing our behaviour*

#### Be easily available

Create a [(permanent hangout)](#permanent-hangout) that people can reach
you on during the day, this makes you equally available as people sitting
in a physical location at the office.

Posting the bit.ly link in the project group chat at the beginning of the
day is a great way of inviting people connect. This also reminds them of
where they can reach you for a quick talk.

#### Meetings

(Work in progress).

When in a meeting think about where you sit relative to microphones and
cameras. Sit close to the microphone and camera. Properly hearing and seeing
all the people in a meeting makes wonders for good communication.

Remove objects that might cause loud noises thought the microphone:

*   Metal bracelets creates a painful noise in the microphone
when scratched against a macbook or the table for example.

Also consider having an all virtual meeting. When everybody have their own
camera and microphone communication is often much better.
This is specially true when you are discussing something visual like
design changes over a shared screen.

(more must be written about this.)

### Tools that remove collaboration barriers

*This section will focus on tools we can use to remove
communication barriers*

*   Effective use of Hangouts
*   Permanent Hangout, with bit.ly link. [(read more bellow)](#permanent-hangout)
*   Good quality microphones (and enough of them)
*   Good quality cameras (and enough of them)

#### Permanent-Hangout

To make a permanent hangout Follow these steps:

1.  Schedule a meeting for the distant future\* with your gmail account
(preferably your private gmail account\**). Be sure to create a hangout session
that belongs to this meeting (should be on by default).

2.  Enter the hangout and copy the hangout link.

3.  Go to bit.ly and create a new account or login. When you have an account
you can customize the link so that it is easy to remember. (Example:
bit.ly/ohenrik)

\* The Hangout will expire a few days after its meeting is held.

\** Scheduling the meeting in a hyper account will make the hangout by default
only allow access to people logged into an hyper.no email account.
You can change this inside the hangout, but you have to do it every time you
connect to the hangout, unless you use your private gmail account.

## Why we all need to think remote

*There is newer just one person working remotely in a team.*

We need to write more about the mentality towards remote collaboration at Hyper.
