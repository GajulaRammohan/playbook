# Workflow

While we have adopted some choice artifacts from Scrum, our workflow is probably
best described as just “agile”. Our projects vary in scope and duration and so
we adopt our workflow accordingly, but there are some key artifacts that we
think a project should always have.

## The backlog

We keep a list of everything that remains to be done. In Scrum, this list is
called the “backlog”. We like to format the items in the list as [user stories]
in the interest of keepings things straightforward and not too technical for
everyone else to follow.

## Stand-ups

Every day, everyone on the team should meet amongst themselves and have a
[stand-up].

We like to timebox stand-ups to 15 minutes where everyone takes turns asking
these questions of themselves:

* What did you do yesterday?
* What will you be doing today?
* Are there any impediments in your way?

## Sprints

We organize the backlog in [sprints]. We like for our sprints to last one to two
weeks each, as our projects seldom span for more than a few months and commonly
much less.

### Sprint planning

At the beginning of each sprint, we have a sprint planning meeting. This is
where we plan the next iteration of your product. At the end of the meeting, the
team should have committed to a sprint's worth of user stories to implement.

We like to timebox sprint plannings to 30 minutes with one specific question in
mind: “What are we doing in the upcoming sprint?”

### Sprint review

At the end of each sprint, we have a sprint review meeting. This is where we
review the previous iteration of your product. At the end of the meeting,
everyone should be agreed that the user stories were implemented satisfactorily.
The stories that are considered complete will be deployed, and the ones that
aren't are moved back into the backlog.

We like to timebox sprint reviews to 30 minutes with on question to answer:
“What have we accomplished in this sprint?”

### Sprint retrospective

As with the sprint review, we also have a sprint retrospective meeting after
each sprint. This is where we look back and review our process. If we didn't
accomplish our goals with the sprint we look back and try to figure out why that
is.

We like to timebox sprint retrospectives to 10 minutes with the following
questions on our agenda:

* What should we start doing?
* What should we stop doing?
* What should we continue doing?
