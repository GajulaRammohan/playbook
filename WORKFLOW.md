# Workflow

These are the ways we work with the rest of the team.

## Agile

While we have adopted some choice artifacts from Scrum, our workflow is best described as
just “agile”. Our projects vary in scope and duration and so we adopt our workflow accordingly,
but there are some key artifacts that we think a project should always have.

### Backlog

We keep a list of everything that remains to do. In Scrum, this list is called the “backlog”. We like
to format the items in the list as [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) in the interest of
keepings things straightforward and not too technical for everyone else to follow.

### Sprints

We organize the backlog in [sprints]('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint').
We like for our sprints to last one week each, as our projects seldom span for more than a few months and
commonly much less.

#### Sprint planning

At the beginning of each sprint, we have a sprint planning meeting. This is where we plan the next
iteration of your product. At the end of the meeting, the team should have committed to a week's worth of
user stories to implement.

We like to timebox sprint plannings to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What are we doing next week?

#### Sprint review

At the end of each sprint, we have a sprint review meeting. This is where we review the previous
iteration of your product. At the end of the meeting, everyone should be agreed that the user stories were
implemented satisfactorily. The stories that are considered complete will be deployed, and the ones that
aren't are moved back into the backlog.

We like to timebox sprint reviews to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What did we do last week?

#### Sprint retrospective

At the end of each sprint, we have a sprint retrospective meeting. This is where we review how we
made the previous iteration of our product.

We like to timebox sprint retrospectives to 10 minutes with the following agenda:

* What should we start doing?
* What should we stop doing?
* What should we continue doing?

### Stand-ups

Every day, everyone on the team should meet amongst themselves and have a
[stand-up](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum/).

We like to timebox stand-ups to 15 minutes where everyone takes turns asking these questions of themselves:

* What did you do yesterday?
* What will you be doing today?
* Are there any impediments in your way?
