# Working Remotely

*The goal of this document is to improve collaboration between people who
 are not working in the same physical location.*

 **Important: This document is not only for those who are working remotely,
 but for everyone working at Hyper.
 Successful collaboration requires effort from everyone.**

## Why remote?

For the last 200,000 years, our only option for working together has been
being together. You could say we're used to it.

But the rules are changing; where we were previously limited by the reach of
our voice, we can now synthesize it into radio signals that can carry it
to Mars.

It's probably not a good idea to work from Mars, though; it'd take anything
you say between 4 and 24 minutes to reach someone on Earth, and you'd probably
die.

It'd be pretty great to work from anywhere on Earth, however! For one thing we
could draw upon the more than seven billion people in the world rather than
just the few hundred thousand in Oslo to build great things with us, and for
another we'd all have the opportunity to see the world while doing it.

Changing the way that people have been doing things for 200,000 years isn't
something we can do overnight, but it is our ambition to change it in five.
When you can stream yourself in 1080p from the top of Mount Everest and
holograms are commonplace, we want to be great at it while the rest scramble
to catch up.

## How to remote?

Remote can be challenging because it requires new and different tools, and
because some of those tools are still in their infancy. A tap on the shoulder
is a message on Slack, a meeting is a Google Hangout and looking over
someone's shoulder is a Kanban board.

While we're changing our toolset for working together, communication barriers
may arise. To be great at remote, it's important that we're open about these
communication barriers and move fast to fix them. As we're doing that, we'll
share what we've learned here so we only have to do it once.

### Tips on removing collaboration barriers

*This section will focus on how we can remove
communication barriers by changing our behaviour*

#### Share where you are

If you're in a different place than usual, tell everyone.

If you're usually at the office but you're working from home today,
let your team know so they don't go looking for you.

If you're usually in New York but travelled to Beijing on a whim,
let your team know so they know you're on a different schedule.

#### Be easily available

Create a [(permanent hangout)](#permanent-hangout) that people can reach
you on during the day, this makes you equally available as people sitting
in a physical location at the office.

Posting the bit.ly link in the project group chat at the beginning of the
day is a great way of inviting people connect. This also reminds them of
where they can reach you for a quick talk.

#### Meetings

(Work in progress).

When in a meeting think about where you sit relative to microphones and
cameras. Sit close to the microphone and camera. Properly hearing and seeing
all the people in a meeting makes wonders for good communication.

Remove objects that might cause loud noises thought the microphone:

*   Metal bracelets creates a painful noise in the microphone
when scratched against a macbook or the table for example.

Also consider having an all virtual meeting. When everybody have their own
camera and microphone communication is often much better.
This is specially true when you are discussing something visual like
design changes over a shared screen.

(more must be written about this.)

### Tools that remove collaboration barriers

*This section will focus on tools we can use to remove
communication barriers*

*   Effective use of Hangouts
*   Permanent Hangout, with bit.ly link. [(read more bellow)](#permanent-hangout)
*   Good quality microphones (and enough of them)
*   Good quality cameras (and enough of them)

#### Permanent-Hangout

To make a permanent hangout Follow these steps:

1.  Schedule a meeting for the distant future\* with your gmail account
(preferably your private gmail account\**). Be sure to create a hangout session
that belongs to this meeting (should be on by default).

2.  Enter the hangout and copy the hangout link.

3.  Go to bit.ly and create a new account or login. When you have an account
you can customize the link so that it is easy to remember. (Example:
bit.ly/ohenrik)

\* The Hangout will expire a few days after its meeting is held.

\** Scheduling the meeting in a hyper account will make the hangout by default
only allow access to people logged into an hyper.no email account.
You can change this inside the hangout, but you have to do it every time you
connect to the hangout, unless you use your private gmail account.
