Hi,

Thanks for your interest in working at Hyper, we are a bunch of likeable guys that enjoy making cool apps and having fun. You'll love it here :)

Even though you can easily convince us to hire you for your good humor, charm, or cool name, we still are really into beautiful code and *wonderful* apps. If you have any cool libraries in GitHub that you can show us, please send them to us, especially if it's one that you use on a daily basis. But if you don't have any, don't feel bad, we have a cool assignment that you'll probably finish in a few hours, the assignment is called Hyper Recipes.

The goal is to make an iOS app to see recipes it can be a list or a grid, just the listing part will do the job but you have other endpoints available in case you're feeling adventurous. You decide how it looks, but we appreciate good looking apps and thoughtful user experiences (get inspiration from the App Store).

We also enjoy making some pop corn and reading your code like a fantasy book of dragons and unicorns. We are crazy about code, please make it beautiful.

We have a nice backend that will take care of your delicious recipes. You can get the documentation of the backend here:

When you are done, please link us to your project in GitHub.

Thanks and we hope you enjoy making some recipes.
