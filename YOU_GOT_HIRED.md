# You got hired!

First things first; congratulations! You must be pretty awesome!

## Thanks! What's next?

Well, that depends.

### I'm already a viking

Just drop by the office, sign the contract and hang out! Then all that's left to do
is count the days. All three months of them.

### I'm becoming a viking

That's great! Now for the bad news. Imagine a rain forest. Now imagine cutting down all the trees
in that rain forest and churning them into paper. That's all the forms we have to fill and letters
we have to send to get you here. But it's okay! We'll get through it! In fact we have sort of a lot
of experience with hiring awesome people.

#### How do I get there?

Whoa there cowboy! If you're from a country outside the EU/EEA, you'll have to apply for a visitor's
visa. This process varies depending on where you're from, but there's an excellent guide on the
[website of The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI)](http://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/visit-and-holiday/)
that will walk you through the specifics.

Once your visa is in order (or if you don't need one), you'll want to get a flight to Oslo Airport Gardermoen
(OSL) and catch a train into town. There's two: The Airport Express ("Flytoget" in Norwegian) or the regular
train. The Airport Express is slightly faster and slightly more expensive. Either way you should get off at
Oslo Sentralbanestasjon. Just let us know when you board the train and we'll meet you there!

#### Where am I going to live?

Traditionally vikings have preferred to live in caves and huts, but currently the preferred places to
inhabit are apartments.

You'll want to find one you like at [finn.no](http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/lettings/result?areaId=20061),
which is Norway's largest market of buying and selling things (including caves and huts and, more recently,
apartments). Unfortunately the damn thing is only available in Norwegian, which really blows our mind. We
recommend using Google Translate, which besides making the ads easier to understand also occasionally
makes them quite hilarious.

The best thing to do is make a list of apartments you like and run them by someone who speaks Norwegian
(like, you know, us) just to make sure you aren't signing up for a nudist community or anything. We recommend
getting in touch with a few landlords by telephone or e-mail prior to arriving here and arranging some viewings
so you can see them for yourself. We'll have a SIM card ready for you when you arrive so you don't drive
yourself into bankruptcy. Your first week here is on us, and we'll get you a nice room at a hotel right
by the office while you get your things in order.

#### When can I start?

If you're from a country in the EU/EEA, you can start working whenever you want. You'll have to [register
with the government](http://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/the-registration-scheme-for-eueea-nationals) no later
than three months after your arrival, though.

If you're from a country outside the EU/EEA, you'll have to [apply for a residence permit as a skilled
worker](http://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/) before you start working. It's a lot of
paperwork, but thankfully the nice guys at The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration have prepared a
[checklist](http://www.udi.no/en/checklists-container/work/checklist-for-skilled-worker-with-an-employer-in-norway/)
for you so you don't forget anything. We'll work on this together. It could take a week or two to
get everything in order, but you'll probably be busy finding an apartment anyway (otherwise
we recommend watching [10 hours of badgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGlyFc79BUE) the requisite
number of times).
